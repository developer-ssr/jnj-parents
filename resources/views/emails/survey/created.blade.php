Important information for Contact Lens Wearers: ACUVUE® Abiliti™ Overnight Therapeutic Contact Lenses are available by prescription only for the management of myopia.

An eye care professional will determine whether these contact lenses are right for you. Although, rare, serious eye problems including vision loss and blindness can develop while wearing contact lenses. To help avoid these symptoms, follow the wear and replacement schedule and the lens care disinfection instructions provided by your eye care professional. Do not wear these contact lenses if you have an eye infection, or experience eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, redness or other eye problems. If one of these conditions occurs, remove the lens and contact your eye care professional immediately. For more information on proper wear, care and safety, talk to your eye care professional and review the Patient Instruction Guide, call 1-800-896-3233, or visit <a href="www.seeyourabiliti.com" target="_blank">www.seeyourabiliti.com</a>.
